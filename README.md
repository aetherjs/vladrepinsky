## Welcome Stranger!

This repository contains source code for my personal website. It is additionally intended to try out different stuff and extend my knowledge in react and other web development tools. Development supervised by a `Vue.js` ninja @yakovm1ke.

## Current Usage
Run development server, test and so on with the classic create-react-app bootstrap scripts: 

```shell
npm install
npm start
npm test
npm run build
npm run eject
```

All development done in `/develop` branch and the stable completed versions are merged to main only via PRs. To publish checkout a stable version from `/main` and run:

```shell
npm run deploy
```
